Interview questions on Recursion

This is for the question , where we are asked to find the subsequence of a given string using recursion : 

if a interviewer asks me can you tell me the time complexity for this code , how can i answer him. Can i say that it is 2 to the power of n where n is the string that we are working with

Yes, that's a great way to explain it! Here's how you can confidently answer this in an interview:

‚úÖ How to Explain the Time Complexity:
"The time complexity of this code is O(2‚Åø), where n is the length of the input string. This is because for each character in the string, we have two choices‚Äîeither to include the character in the subsequence or to exclude it.

As a result, the total number of subsequences generated is 
2
ùëõ
2 
n
 , which directly reflects the number of recursive calls the algorithm will make."

‚úÖ Additional Points (If Interviewer Asks More):
Why exponential?

"It's exponential because for every character, the decision to include or exclude it doubles the possibilities, leading to 
2
ùëõ
2 
n
  combinations."

What about space complexity?

"The space complexity is O(n) because the maximum depth of the recursion stack will be n, which corresponds to the length of the string."
